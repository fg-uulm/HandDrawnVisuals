# HandDrawnVisuals

A HTML/SVG/JS project which generates hand-drawing-style ornament visuals

* Best used with the CEF Spout project which can be found on my github, and your favourite mapping application (e.g. MadMapper)
* Based on rough.js
* The code is messy, I'm sorry for that

A sample of how this can be used in a real setting:
