# HandDrawnVisuals

A HTML/SVG/JS project which generates hand-drawing-style ornament visuals

* Best used with the CEF Spout project which can be found on my github
* Based on rough.js
* Code is messy, I'm sorry for that

![A sample of how this can be used in a real setting:](https://github.com/fg-uulm/HandDrawnVisuals/blob/master/example.jpg)
